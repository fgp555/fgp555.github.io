## Icons

Do not add an icon CDN library (Lucide via unpkg, Font Awesome, etc.) for icons. Instead, copy the specific SVG(s) needed directly inline into the HTML, matching the stroke-based outline style already used for the theme-toggle sun/moon icons (`stroke="currentColor"`, `stroke-width="2"`, round line caps/joins — Lucide's visual style, sourced by hand rather than loaded from a library). This keeps the site free of extra external script dependencies while staying visually consistent.

I define love as three thing
it's when you like someones personality
it's when you respect their values
and when you want to commit
to helping them achieve their goals
that is love in action
that is love in practice
that is love in reality

what's a soulmate?

It's a... well, it's like a best friend, but more
It's the one person in the world
who knows you better than anyone else.
It's someone who makes you a better person.

Actually, they don't make you a better person,
you do that yourself because they inspire you.
a soulmate is someone who you carry with you forever

4 behaviors that will make people respect you

1. don't be like a chicken with its head cut off
   move slowly relax
   this gives the impression that you're in control
   and that you move at your own pace
   you don't give in to the pressure of others

2. dressing better will make you feel better
   remember god sees what's inside
   but in the business world people see the outside
   they shouldn't judge you but they do
   even if no one says so

3. speak less
   speaking less create a mystery
   that peaks people's interest
   and makes them want to know more about you

4. stay calm in the face of the storm and listen
   before you react with desperation or anger
   this will create a small space for you to return to your center
   and make assertive decisions

if you want to learn more about how to be a high value person
and you want to be in control follow me

I wanna marry a man
who gets more excited about my birthday than I do,
someone who plans little surprises
just because he loves seeing my eyes light up,
someone who remembers the stories behind the things I care about

and never treats my joy like an inconvenience,
I wanna marry the man who asks
how my day really was and waits for the answer,
the one who holds my hand in public
and holds my heart in private with the same gentle care,

I wanna marry the man who knows
love is not grand gestures only,
the man who chooses me even when the world is not watching,
the one who looks at growing old with me
like it is something to look forward to,

who believes love gets better with time not boring,
who knows that forever in made just from moments like these

If you cry when you are angry,
psychology says you are not weak,
you are emotionally powerful.

Crying during anger happens when
your fight or flight system clashes with your emotional brain.
Your body is ready to defend,
but your mind overflows with energy it cannot put into words,
so it releases it through tears.

This is not sadness,
it is your nervous system trying to keep you safe from burning out.
People who cry when they are mad often have higher empathy
and emotional intelligence.

They feel anger, hurt, and frustration all at once,
so the line between them disappears.
Tears become your body's way of releasing cortisol,
the stress hormone, while calming your heart rate.
It is your brain saying,
I am protecting you from going too far.

Studies show women experience this more often,
not because they are too emotional,
but because their brains are wired to express emotions faster and deeper.
So if you cry when you are angry, do not apologize.
Your tears are not weakness, they are proof of strength.

The beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears,
the figure that she carries,
or the way she combs her hair.

The beauty of a woman is seen in her eyes,
because that is the doorway to her heart,
the place where love resides.

If you don't keep these five boundaries,
you're probably gonna break up.

1. We don't disappear when things get hard.
   We take space when needed, but we always come back.

2. We don't keep each other guessing.
   When we have needs, we speak them out loud
   and we allow the other person to meet those needs.

3. We don't just go silent and walk away.
   If we need a break, we let the other person know
   and we let them know when we're coming back.

4. We don't compete for who's right and who's wrong.
   We seek understanding, not for a winner and a loser.

5. We don't prioritize comfort over truth.
   We're honest, even when it's hard.

   If you want safety and security in your relationships,
   but it's not that way right now, read the caption.

There's four questions I asked my husband before we got married.
I've known him since I was 11.
One, what do you truly want your life to look like?
What do you both want to do?
Do you want to work?
Where do you want to live?
Marriage isn't about guessing your way
through the important decisions.
It's about building a shared vision
before you sign up for forever.
Number two, do you want kids or not?
Sounds simple, but most people never actually talk about it.
They just assume and figure it out later.
Later usually means resentment.
You need to know now.
Three, what's your ethical compass?
In your mind, what makes a good and a bad person?
Are you into monogamy, polyamory, cheating, faith in God?
Your foundation is super hard to reset.
Number four, what does a life well-lived look like?
And what are you willing to sacrifice to get it?
Don't just tell them your goals.
Tell them what you're going to do to get them.
No matter what it is, you need to know.
My team asked me to write down the 15 questions
that I would ask if I wasn't married, so I did that.
Comment, marry me, and you can see
if this helps you like it did me.

The person you love most is also the one who triggers you most.
That's not a coincidence, it's how love actually works.
Your partner isn't there just to make you happy.
They're there to show you the parts of yourself you've been avoiding.
The wounds you haven't healed, the patterns you keep repeating,
the way they challenge you, the way they make you feel exposed and vulnerable.
That's not a problem with your relationship.
That's love doing its job.
Real love doesn't just comfort you.
It forces you to grow.
It holds up a mirror to your worst habits and deepest fears.
It makes you confront the version of yourself you'd rather ignore.
That's why relationships are so hard.
You're not just dealing with another person.
You're dealing with everything they bring up in you that you thought you had handled.
Love isn't supposed to be easy.
It's supposed to change you.

If a man is always there for you,
don't confuse consistency with weakness.
If a man is available to you when you call,
when you need his presence, he shows up,
you text him, he replies, you call him, he picks up.
That's not luck, that's commitment.
And that kind of man should never be taken for granted.
Because most people don't realize someone's value
until they're gone.
Don't let that be your lesson.
A man who is reliable, present, and consistent
is not a man with nothing better to do.
It doesn't mean he lacks options.
It doesn't mean he has no friends or no life.
It means that out of everything he could be doing,
he consistently chooses to make time for you.
And that choice is rare.

To maintain a lasting relationship, here are seven things you must do with your partner.

1. communicate honestly, even when it's uncomfortable.
2. listen to understand, not just to respond.
3. choose respect during disagreements.
4. make time for each other consistently.
5. support each other's growth and dreams.
6. practice forgiveness without keeping score.
7. never stop choosing each other every day,
   because love that lasts is built on intention, not perfection.

When a man stops talking, it's not because he doesn't care anymore, it's because he's tired of fighting.
Look, guys don't just pull away because they've stopped loving you,
and they pull away because coming home has started to feel like walking into a war zone.
When a man shuts down, he's not trying to push you out, he's just trying to protect what's left of his sanity.
He didn't just wake up and decide to be different.
He became exactly what he had to be because of the energy you've been putting out.
You might think his silence is a sign of weakness, or that his boundaries mean he's being cold and distant.
You might even think he's lost his passion because he's not reacting anymore.
But here's what you're missing.
A man who is just trying to find some peace and quiet isn't trying to hurt your feelings.
He's not playing games.
He's just trying to survive the relationship.
He's not checking out to be mean.
And he's checking out because he doesn't have anything left to give to a fight that never ends.

You text me when you have time.
I text you as soon as I see your message.
That's the difference between us.
For me, it's not just about replying.
It's about showing that I care that you matter enough
to make your priority.
But for you, I'm just another task on your list,
something to get to when it's convenient.
I've realized that love, effort, and attention
can't be forced.
They have to come naturally.
And if I'm constantly the one who cares more,
who tries harder, then maybe I need to step back.
Maybe it's time to stop chasing someone
who only makes time for me when it fits their schedule.
Love isn't about convenience.
It's about consistency.
It's about showing up even when it's not easy.
I deserve someone who values me the way I value them.
Someone who doesn't make me feel like I'm always waiting.
All second guessing my worth.
So if you only text me when you have time,
maybe it's time to stop replying.

the woman who chooses herself will lose people but she'll never lose peace again
she'll lose comfort but she'll gain clarity she'll lose approval but she'll find freedom
she'll lose what was never meant for her and make space for everything that is
because choosing yourself means outgrowing what doesn't grow you
it means saying no without guilt and walking away without bitterness
it means becoming the woman who no longer begs to be seen because she finally sees herself
choosing yourself is not selfish it's sacred

The biggest sign of a partner that's supporting your healing is not what you think it is.
It is their ability to stay regulated when you're not.
It's not grand gestures.
It's not always saying the right thing.
It's not reading every book or going to every therapy session with you.
It's this.
When you're activated, when your trauma response is running the show,
they don't match your energy.
They don't collapse.
They don't get defensive.
They don't make your pain about them.
They stay.
They breathe.
They hold the container.
That doesn't mean they never get triggered.
It doesn't mean they're perfect.
But in the moment that matters most, when you're spiraling or shutting down,
they can anchor themselves enough not to escalate or abandon.
Because here's the truth.
Healing doesn't happen in isolation.
It happens in relationship.
And the most healing thing your partner can do isn't fix you.
It's prove over and over
that your nervous system can come back online while still being connected to them.
That's the work.
That's the love.
That's what changes everything.

One thing about me is I never believe a story
until I've heard it from both sides.
So if someone comes to me and they start venting about their opinion about a person
and their experience with that person,
I will never take it as truth until I have talked to that person myself
because I know how gossip works and I know how sly and manipulative people can be.

One study shows that when people hear others' opinions,
they often change their own views to match them.
Even when the facts say something different,
that is how powerful influence is and that is how gossip spreads.
Now, this is different if you're asking for your opinion on a restaurant
and you've heard 10 other people say that the place kind of sucks.
Totally different story. That is just feedback.

But when it comes to someone's character,
you can't always trust secondhand stories.
We have to remember that some people lie.
Some people do not have good intentions.
Some people are jealous
and some people project their own insecurities just to tear other people down.
So I want to encourage you,
be very careful who you listen to
and filter wisely because what someone says about others
always reveals more about them than about the person they're talking about.

You're about to lose the guy everyone else is praying to find,
and you're doing it to yourself.
Do you even realize how bad you're messing this up right now?

Seriously. This guy is doing everything in his power to show you he's all in.
He's trying to be your rock through all your overthinking and those moments when you're spiraling.
And what are you doing? You're pushing him away.
For what? Guys who actually give a damn are incredibly rare these days,
like needle in a haystack rare.
And here you are treating him like he's nothing.

Everyone I know is out here asking, where are all the good men at?
Well, look up. He's standing right in front of you.
Don't blow it.
If you love him the way you say you do,
then for once, actually show it.
Stop sidelining him.

Because all you're doing is convincing him that being a good man doesn't pay off.
You're showing him that no matter how hard he tries,
it's never going to be enough and he's just going to get played.
That's exactly how you turn a good man cold.
That's how you create the toxic guys you claim to hate.
Don't be the reason a good guy gets ruined
just because you're too stuck in your own head to see what you've got.

Maybe the reason you're so good
at understanding everyone around you,
seeing their pain, their patterns, their complexity,
is because deep down
you wish someone would finally do the same for you.
You have this insatiable desire to feel seen and understood.
You wish someone would see your complexity,
your contradictions, the magic inside of you,
all the ways that you quietly hold everything together.

To have someone look at you and just get it.
Not just see the version that you present or the ways that you perform,
but all of the layers underneath.
So you pour that attention and understanding into others,
hoping it'll be reflected back.
But it never quite is.

In fact, it seems to constantly leave you feeling even more unseen and misunderstood,
doesn't it?
See, the thing is,
no one else's understanding of you will ever quite meet the depths that you crave.
Not because you're unworthy of it,
but because you're likely trying to fill a void that's been there since childhood.

A void that resulted from never really feeling fully known,
fully understood, fully nurtured.
And now, as an adult, no one else can really give you that.
Yes, healthy relationships and healthy reflection are important,
but no one else can hand you your identity
or validate your existence in a way that will finally make you feel whole.

The only person who can truly see you in the ways that you are dying to be seen is you.
And that's actually fantastic news, if you allow it to be.

The person who is right for you
is the person who's going to make the effort to be with you.
That sounds so obvious that it's almost stupid to say out loud,
but so many people screw this up that I feel like it needs to be said.
Because it's not complicated.
People who want a future with you are going to act like it.
They will show up, they're going to reach out,
they're going to follow through.

But when somebody's inconsistent, when they're flaky,
when they're confused,
when they always have something going on
or something came up or oh my god I never could have planned for this,
then that is your answer.

If the person's not there, if they're not showing up,
then clearly they don't want to be there.
You don't have to chase them,
you don't have to convince them,
you don't have to earn them.

Just accept that if they wanted to be here, they would be here.
Ultimately you will meet the people at the standards that you set for yourself.
If you accept weak, indecisive, selfish behavior from people, then that's what you'll get.
